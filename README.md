# Second-Pageflex-Extension
This extension checks if we are on the shipping page for ordering and changes the shiping and handling charges to the hardcoded values we set in our extension

This is the second extesnion I wrote that builds on the first to add the use of more methods


Methods:
1. DisplayName()
2. UniqueName()
3. IsModuleType (string x) (determines if at shipping step)
4. CalculateHandlingCharge ()
5. CalculateShippingCharge2 ()
